# GAr TPC meant to fit inside the standard dipole geometry.
# This would be rotated 90 deg around the y-axis so that the 
# drift in the detector z direction is in the global x direction
# Because the HP chamber is a cylinder, there would necessarily
# be a lot of empty space left in the dipole for additional detectors
# In principle, it would be possible to have cylindrical TPC volumes that
# would better use the chamber volume
